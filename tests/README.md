# kirjava's Tests

These were mainly used by me to perform tests on the library to check that it was functional in a manner that I could verify by hand.  

## Compiling

Compiling these would require a mixture of using `javac` and ![ProGuard's assembler](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard-assembler) (which is inconvenient I know, sorry).  
I have provided the compiled classes alongside the source code though.

## Future plans

I do plan on providing proper (automated) tests in the future, however I am more focused on getting the library fully functional first.

## Samples

I have provided some of the samples I use for testing, unfortunately a good majority of them are private and I won't be able to publish them.  
If you do want good samples, some excellent public ones can be found at:
 - ![CAFED00D](https://github.com/Col-E/CAFED00D/tree/master/src/test/resources/samples) by ![Matt Coley](https://github.com/Col-E).
 - ![Krakatau](https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau/tree/master/tests) by ![Robert Grosse](https://github.com/Storyyeller) (who as a sidenote has some great crackmes to test on).
 - ![Fernflower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower/tree/master/testData) by JetBrains.

## Sidenote

If I have used any of your classes please let me know and I'll add you to the credits.
