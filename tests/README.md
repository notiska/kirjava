# kirjava's Tests

**Warning: although most of these classes are benign, they are still should not be run on local machines.**

## Unit tests

These can be run safely as they do not "interpret" the classes in any meaningful way.

## Compiling

Compiling these would require a mixture of using `javac` and [ProGuard's assembler](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard-assembler) (which is inconvenient I know, sorry).  
I have provided the compiled classes alongside the source code though.

## Samples

Note: if I have used any of your classes without permission, feel free to let me know publicly or privately and I can take the appropriate actions.
